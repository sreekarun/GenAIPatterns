# GenAI Patterns

A comprehensive collection of patterns, examples, and best practices for Generative AI applications. This mono repo contains Python solutions for various GenAI use cases including MCP (Model Context Protocol), OpenAI Agentic Framework, LangGraph, and more.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a practical guide and reference implementation for common Generative AI patterns, helping developers:

- Understand key concepts and architectures
- Implement production-ready solutions
- Follow best practices and avoid common pitfalls
- Deploy and host AI applications effectively

   cd GenAIPatterns
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Choose a pattern**
   Navigate to the specific pattern directory you're interested in:
