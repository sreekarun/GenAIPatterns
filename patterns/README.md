# Implementation Patterns

This directory contains practical implementation patterns and examples for various Generative AI use cases.

## Available Patterns

### [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](./mcp/)
Complete implementation examples for building MCP servers and clients, including:
- Simple server and client implementations
- Advanced patterns with authentication and error handling
- Integration examples
- Deployment and hosting solutions

## Pattern Structure

Each pattern follows a consistent structure:
```
pattern_name/
├── README.md              # Pattern overview and quick start
├── server/                # Server implementation examples
├── client/                # Client implementation examples
├── examples/              # Complete integration examples
└── requirements.txt       # Pattern-specific dependencies
```

## Using Patterns

1. Navigate to the pattern directory
2. Review the README for overview and prerequisites
3. Install pattern-specific dependencies
4. Follow the implementation guides
5. Adapt examples to your specific use case

## Contributing New Patterns

When adding new patterns:
1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Provide clear documentation
3. Include working code examples
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Update this README
